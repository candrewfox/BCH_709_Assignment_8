This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

##package install and loading
##package installs commented out
##DO NOT CHANGE UNLESS NECESSARY
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("gapminder")
library("tidyverse")
library("gapminder")
data("gapminder")
```

##Load gapminder dataset into data frame
```{r}
gapminder_table <- gapminder
gapminder_table
```


##Data summary of gapminder data frame
```{r}
summary(gapminder_table)
```

##Histogram of population (log transformed)
```{r}
hist(log(pop))
```

##Scatterplot of life expectancy and log transformed gdp per capita
```{r}
plot(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap))
```

##T-Test of life expectancy differences between South Africa and Ireland
```{r}
df1 <- gapminder %>%
select(country,lifeExp) %>%
 filter(country== "South Africa" |
            country== "Ireland")
  
  t.test(data = df1, lifeExp ~ country)

```

##Single-plot of life expectancy and gdp per capita, colored by continent, dot sized by population, smoothed
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap < 50000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log(gdpPercap), y=lifeExp, col=continent, size=pop))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)
```
##Faceted scatterplot, colored by year, faceted by continent, smoothed
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap < 50000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log(gdpPercap), y=lifeExp, col=year, size=pop))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
facet_wrap(~continent)
```

##linear model test of life expectancy by gdp per capita and population, summary included
```{r}

summary(lm(lifeExp ~gdpPercap+pop))
```
